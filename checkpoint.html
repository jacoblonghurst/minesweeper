        <ol>
            <li>Determine which square the user is clicking on.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>You just need to click on any square in the minesweeper board</li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>Determine which button was clicked. i.e. If it was the left or right or both
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>You cannot see the logic behind which button was clicked in the view,
                        however the logic is in the code.</li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>If the square is a left click, then check if the square is a mine
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>We run a check first once we make a left click to see if it's a mine</li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>If the square is a mine, then run endGame() and present the user with an option to start again.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>To see this you simply need to click on a mine. If you don't know which square's a mine
                        then you can keep clicking on the board until you hit one </li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>If it's not a mine then reveal the square, change the square to display the correct number of mines
                touching those squares and all run against adjacent squares that aren't mines.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>To see this you only need to make a left click on any square on the board that isn't a mine</li>
                    <li>This was the most difficult piece to get the logic correct since I needed to recurse on
                        any square that didn't have any mines touching it and only reveal the squares that had mines
                        touching them.</li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>If it's a right click, toggle placing a flag on or off the square
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>You simply need to right click on any square and it will place a flag or remove a flag</li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>If it's a left and right click check if the coordinate is a mine or has a flag, and check if the
                square has been revealed to show the number corresponding to how many mines are touching the square
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Not Implemented</li>
                    <li>If it doesn't have a flag and isn't a mine and isn't revealed then don't do anything</li>
                    <li>If it is revealed then check if the number of flags touching the square correspond to the
                        number of mines touching the square.
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>If it does then run revealSquares() on all adjacent squares and recurse
                                through this whole process again.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li><br />
            <li>If you have revealed all squares except the mines, you win the game
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implemented</li>
                    <li>Win the game and you'll see the ending. HINT: turn on your volume</li>
